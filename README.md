# A Neural Span-Based Continual Named Entity Recognition Model

Source code for AAAI 2023 paper: A Neural Span-Based Continual Named Entity Recognition Model [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12200.pdf)]  
[[Appendix for AAAI paper](Paper_Appendix.pdf)]

## 1. Prerequisites

```
# Environment
- python >= 3.6

# Dependencies
- torch >= 1.8
- transformers == 4.3.0
- rich
- prettytable
- paramiko  # [Option] if need to remotely open file.
```


## 2. Dataset
- [OntoNotes 5.0](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19)
- [Few-NERD](https://ningding97.github.io/fewnerd)


We provide the pre-processed datasets in `data/` DIR, which keep the same sample-task allocation for split setup experimented in the paper for reproduction.

[Update 20230525ðŸ”¥] We provide the zip file of `data/` as `data.zip` for convenient, since the original `data/` used LFS and need Github quota ðŸ˜‘. Please unzip it before running the code.ðŸ˜Š
## 3. Training

```shell
python train_clner.py \
      --gpu 0 \
      --m spankl \
      --corpus onto \
      --setup split \
      --perm perm0
      
# gpu: which gpu to use. (-2: auto allocate gpu -1: use cpu)
# m: types of model (spankl|add|ext)
# corpus: (onto|fewnerd)
# setup: (split|filter)
# perm: task learning order, default perm0 (perm0|perm1|...)
```
**Note** that this yields results regarding **one of** the Task Permutation (e.g., --perm0), while Tab.1 and Tab.2 in the paper are the results averaged over all the Task Permutations.  

**Update 0305! #1** For convenience, we log the final metric used in the paper at each incremental step (Task) during training, as belows:
```angular2html
...
INFO     Test All Final MacroF1 over Task-Level:{metric}
...
INFO     Test Filter Final MacroF1 over Task-Level:{metric}
...
```
and also provide an overivew of the performance learned so far:
```angular2html
# Logging example when the running finishs (All tasks have been learned on OntoNotes).

```
The table is organized as (Table Format):
```angular2html
                Task1_metric Task2_metric ... MicroF1 MacroF1
Learn to Task1
Learn to Task2
...
BI (backward interference / forgetting)
```
The **last columns** are the metrics of each step used in the paper.

##### More ways to print the above CL metrics:
After and during training, an `overview_metric.json` file will be generated in `model_ckpt/[MODEL_INFO]/` recording the required details, and you can:
- refer to `__main__` in `print_cl_metric.py` to use `print_cl_metric()` func to **remotely** print results.
- or refer to the end of `train_clner.py` to use a wrapped `simply_print_cl_metric()` func to **locally** print results.
